# MarketMuse Design Rationale

## System Architecture Decisions

### 1. Microservices-Based Architecture
**Decision**: Implement a microservices architecture with separate frontend and backend services.
**Rationale**:
- Enables independent scaling of UI and processing components
- Allows for easier maintenance and deployment
- Facilitates technology-specific optimizations
- Supports future expansion of agent capabilities

### 2. Agent-Based Processing
**Decision**: Implement specialized agents for different aspects of marketing analysis.
**Rationale**:
- Enables focused expertise in specific domains
- Allows parallel processing of different aspects
- Makes the system more maintainable and extensible
- Provides clear separation of concerns

### 3. Asynchronous Processing
**Decision**: Use async/await patterns for all agent interactions.
**Rationale**:
- Improves system responsiveness
- Enables parallel processing of agent tasks
- Better resource utilization
- Reduced latency for complex queries

## Prompt Design Decisions

### 1. Structured Response Format
**Decision**: Enforce strict JSON response formats for all agents.
**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent data structure
- Simplifies response parsing
- Reduces integration complexity
- Enables better error handling

### 2. Context-Aware Prompts
**Decision**: Include relevant context in each agent's prompt.
**Rationale**:
- Improves response accuracy
- Reduces hallucination
- Maintains conversation coherence
- Enables better decision making

### 3. Confidence Scoring
**Decision**: Include confidence scores in agent responses.
**Rationale**:
- Provides transparency in decision making
- Helps in response aggregation
- Enables better error handling
- Guides user trust in recommendations

## Agent Coordination Decisions

### 1. Centralized Orchestration
**Decision**: Use a central orchestrator for task distribution.
**Rationale**:
- Simplifies coordination logic
- Provides clear control flow
- Easier to implement error handling
- Better state management

### 2. Parallel Processing
**Decision**: Process agent tasks concurrently.
**Rationale**:
- Reduces overall response time
- Better resource utilization
- Improved user experience
- Scalable to more agents

### 3. Response Aggregation
**Decision**: Implement sophisticated response aggregation.
**Rationale**:
- Combines insights effectively
- Resolves conflicts between agents
- Provides coherent recommendations
- Maintains response quality

## Technology Choices

### 1. Frontend: React + TypeScript
**Decision**: Use React with TypeScript for frontend development.
**Rationale**:
- Strong type safety
- Component reusability
- Rich ecosystem
- Excellent developer experience

### 2. Backend: FastAPI + Python
**Decision**: Use FastAPI with Python for backend services.
**Rationale**:
- Fast performance
- Easy async support
- Strong typing
- Great for AI/ML integration

### 3. API Design: REST
**Decision**: Implement RESTful API endpoints.
**Rationale**:
- Simple to understand
- Widely supported
- Easy to debug
- Good tooling support

## User Experience Decisions

### 1. Progressive Response Display
**Decision**: Show agent responses as they arrive.
**Rationale**:
- Provides immediate feedback
- Reduces perceived latency
- More engaging interface
- Better user experience

### 2. Error Handling
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling.
**Rationale**:
- Improves system reliability
- Better user feedback
- Easier debugging
- Maintains system stability

### 3. Response Formatting
**Decision**: Use structured, hierarchical response display.
**Rationale**:
- Improves readability
- Better information hierarchy
- Easier to scan
- More professional appearance
